Server:

A simple Node/Express app with 1 api endpoint and mocha/chai tests
The project has been setup from scratch using npm

To run: npm start
To run tests: npm test

For production use will need a lot of extra stuff: hotreload, middleware, logging, webpack, linting to name a few

Also, the data would be served from a remote location, not local drive. And the data should be streamed.
